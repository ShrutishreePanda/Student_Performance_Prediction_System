🎓 AI-Based Student Performance Prediction System

This project predicts whether a student will **Pass or Fail** using Machine Learning.

It uses academic factors such as:

- Study Hours  
- Attendance Percentage  
- Previous Exam Score  
- Assignment Marks  

The model is trained using **Logistic Regression**, a supervised learning algorithm for binary classification.

📌 Problem Statement

Manual analysis of student performance is time-consuming.  
This project automates prediction to help institutions identify weak students early.

---

⚙️ System Architecture

**Input:** Student Academic Data  
**Processing:** Data Preprocessing + ML Model Training  
**Output:** Pass/Fail Prediction  

---

🧠 Algorithm Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Binary Classification (Pass = 1, Fail = 0)
