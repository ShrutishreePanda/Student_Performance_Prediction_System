🎓 AI-Based Student Performance Prediction System

This project predicts whether a student will **Pass or Fail** using Machine Learning.

It uses academic factors such as:

- Study Hours  
- Attendance Percentage  
- Previous Exam Score  
- Assignment Marks  

The model is trained using **Logistic Regression**, a supervised learning algorithm for binary classification.
